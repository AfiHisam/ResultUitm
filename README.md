<h3>Generate result link before SALAM due date </h3>
<p>
As UITM student i think most of you have heard about one way to view your result one or two days earlier before the
SALAM email using your pervious result link ?
<p>
Using this website is it right ?
<br>
https://resultuitm.github.io/resultuitm/
<br>
But that website has too many ads that annoying me, so why not we create our version that free from that frustrating ads
<br>
So here the code for those who wondering how the backend on it.
<p> Step to use same as before 
<pre>
--Open e-mail and find last semester result only."UiTM EXAMINATION RESULT FOR SEMESTER" In other word,
open last semester's result.

--Click right on "Print Result Online Svr 1", click COPY link address and PASTE it here.

--Click "SUBMIT" button.
</pre>
<p>
DONE !!!
